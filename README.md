# Plant-domain-classification
A classification approach to classify plant domains 

Here is an approach to classify plant domains such as tree, branches, and leaves.
there are two versions that I have implemented. 
They are utilizing Keras and Pytorch libraries. 

In keras version, it is utilizing efficientNet and resNet50 models.
In pytorch version, it is utilizing resNet34 model.
